An python web app + arduino project micro 


for any difficulties reach me here{ (www.facebook.com/rohit.jain.1993)/ (rj.2929@yahoo.com) }

 it is a python  + arduino based rss feeder !!!
On lcd  will show rss feeds from facebook + gmail  + blink led(s) (differnt leds for different streams ) + play sound 

you have to first burn the arduino code located in arduino sketch (for geting started on arduino see - www.arduino.org/playground )
   
for circuit diagram  and more refer here(http://www.aungthiha.me/2012/04/physical-priority-gmail-notifier-and.html)

I have also taken the arduino code (and made my changes located in arduino sketch) and circuit diagram  from above site!!
 
i have also tried to make a simple web app for configuring the user info ...!!
just paste the contents of cgi bin folder located in config folder...
and rest you can figure it out ....

just change some setttngs in settings.py - com port 
and also open rss.py to make neccesary changes
located in python folder 


also change neccessary database settings in dbconfig.py located in config folder


Also make sure to install the neccesary dependencies in dependencies folder

Software required -- arduino + python + its dependencies
Hardware required -Arduino uno board + leds + pizo speaker +lcd +wires
